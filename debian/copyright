This is the Debian GNU/Linux libio-stringy-perl version of the
Finance-YahooQuote package by Dj Padzensky <djpadz@padz.net>.
Finance-YahooQuote provides a Perl module to pull one or more stock quotes
from Yahoo! Finance.

This package was put together by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
from sources obtained from 
	http://www.padz.net/~djpadz/YahooQuote/

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files. The package was renamed (and converted to lowercase) to match the
Debian Policy which aims at consistent names for Perl Module packages.
