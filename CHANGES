finance-yahooquote (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * YahooQuote.pm: Several changes based on an excellent patch by Jay Strauss
    - makes much more extended set of query symbols available
    - new function getcustomquote() to specify symbols per call
    - new function setQueryString() to supply new query string
    - new functions useExtendedQueryFormat() and useRealtimeQueryFormat()
      as simpler wrappers to make new functionality available
    - getquote() remains backwards-compatible
    - internal switch to retrieve in batches of 199 if more symbols are
      supplied in order to circumvent a restricton at Yahoo's end
    - added new regression test cases for the new functions
    - added some documentation for new functions

  * This is now a Debian 'native' package, i.e. no .diff.gz is provided as
    the sources are identical for the package and the upstream distribution.

    - YahooQuote.pm: supports proxy and authentication proxy with new 
      (and exported) variables PROXY, PROXYUSER, PROXYPASSWD.
  
    - yahooquote: expanded version of the old quote-test example, added
      --verbose switch, POD documentaion and an example demonstrating 
      the global scope of Finance::YahooQuote.
  
    - Makefile.PL: appropriate changes to support changes
  
    - examples/examine_server.sh: New script to examine different servers 
      and URL strings to examine exactly what information is provided
  
    - examples/symbol_alias.sh: New script to find aliases for numeric
      (i.e. cusip-like) stock symbols.
